\section{Tecplot}

Tecplot is a visualization package created by Amtec Engineering, Inc.
out of Bellevue, Washington.  The package was originally designed for
visualization of the output of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
codes and now is a good multipurpose visualization package.  
The strengths of Tecplot are the point and click interface, the 
wide range of options and the ability to produce high quality
three dimensional images in postscript, encapsulated postscript, tiff
and other formats.  The package comes with detailed
documentation for processing data and creating images.

Tecplot requires a license.

\section{IDL}

IDL is well suited to visualize 1D and 2D data on structured and 
unstructured (AMR) grids, and 3D data on structured grids. 
It is a full programming language that can perform complex
data processing and visualization tasks efficiently.
The IDL programs developed for the SWMF can be found
in the {\tt share/IDL/} directory including detailed 
documentation.

IDL requires a license, although it can be used in demo mode
for free. Each session is limited to 7 minutes, which is 
actually sufficient to create plots.

\section{Matlab}

Matlab requires a license.

\section{VisIt}

VisIt is a high performance visualization package that
can render 3d data efficiently.
It can read the HDF5 output with extension .batl.

Visit is free.

\section{Paraview}

Paraview is a high performance visualization package.
It can render 3D data efficiently using parallel processing. 

Paraview is free.

\section{Julia}

The VisAna package was developed by Hongyang Zhu starting from 2019
to read, process and visualize SWMF output files. 
VisAna is written in Julia, which is a modern efficient programming
language. It is available in {\tt share/Julia}. 

VisAna is an open source program.

\section{Python}

Python is a very popular object oriented programming language. 
SpacePy has been developed to read and visualize SWMF output. 
The swmfpy package in {\tt share/Python} 
can perform various tasks related to the SWMF. 

Python, SpacePy, swmfpy are all open source.
