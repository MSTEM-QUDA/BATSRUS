  Test input file for Spectrum2 code (spherical version).
  The spherical Spectrum2 code uses the native BATSRUS grid: you will need to 
save a "3d all idl" format file at the required time of your simulation, which 
generates .out, .info, and .tree files. Indicate the file path without the
suffixes with #DATAFILE.
  Currently I assume the BATSRUS repository you run Spectrum2 is configured the
same as the one you run (on remote machine), say, Awsom code. That is, the block
cells (e.g., -g=6,4,4) needs to be the same (of course); and the equations used
(e.g., -e=MhdWavesHypPe) are assumed to be the same. In the future the equation 
restriction should be lifted.
  You can specify the observer location in HGR coordinates. HCI coordinate and
satellite names will be supported soon. The rotation of the camera field of view
is currently not supported.
  Doppler shift is tested to be not working properly at this time. Alfven wave
option is not yet tested. Please leave the value of those two tags to be false.
  This parameter file is based on the original Spectrum code's parameters, and
shows the usage of the added options. No test input files are attached since 
I still need to cross compare results between two versions of the code.
